What is the internet doing to me?,"You use the Internet all the time. Your actions and data are used by service providers for your benefit, but also for their benefit, and often in ways that are extremely opaque to you as a user. Understanding more about how that works and what you can control will enable you to make better decisions as to what you do or do not want from your interactions with the Internet."
The EthicsLab: Responsible Action in the Real World,"We are constantly challenged by ethical dilemmas: about the future use of technology and artificial intelligence; about the possibilities of genetic and biomedical engineering; about the culture and behaviour of global financial institutions; about who decides who should pay for what; about the environment, about migration, about political leadership. Citizens of a democratic society need to make ethically informed decisions about these issues, and if you are interested in investigating current and future issues in ethics then this is the module for you.  The EthicsLab is an innovative way to explore ethical issues, where you will learn from professors in different subjects across the university, and engage with leading thinkers about how the major global challenges can be addressed.  We will debate the importance of values and their prioritization, ethical biases and blind-spots, intentions and consequences, and we will do this in a lab-environment where everyone will be involved in designing solutions for the ethical issues of the day.

Hacking your health: the science of exercise and fitness,"Exercise training enables the human body to do incredible things like run 100m in under 10 seconds or finish a marathon in under 2 hours. But exercise science is not just about breaking records - it has the potential to change the health of the world. Research shows that regular exercise can significantly reduce risk of cancer, heart and metabolic disease and improve mental health. If you want to know more about the science of exercise – from the physiology of elite athletes to how physical activity guidelines shape the health of the general population -  then this is the Trinity Elective for you."
Creativity and Technology,"In this module, you will explore music and audio production basics, learn about the post-war European contributions to modern music technology, understand the evolution of music production techniques, and acquire video creation and editing skills based on early filmmaker and visual artist techniques."
Cultures and Societies of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA),"A global world needs global citizens, individuals who are well-informed about the cultures and societies of regions of the world which until recently have been regarded as only of indirect relevance to European and Western societies. This module examines Western perspectives on the Middle East and North Africa. What are the origins, presuppositions and theoretical foundations of these? Having examined Western perspectives, students are given the opportunity to hear the views of undergraduates in universities throughout MENA region. How do Western interventions and perspectives look from their point of view?"
Irish Sign Language,"Did you know that Irish Sign Language is Ireland’s third official language, after Irish and English? Irish Sign Language is the indigenous language of the Deaf community in Ireland. It is a language like any other language, but it happens to use signs rather than sounds. There are many different sign languages in the world in the same way as there are different spoken languages. Sign languages are full-fledged natural languages with their own grammar and vocabulary. This Trinity Elective will allow you to develop some communication skills in Irish Sign Language, and explore a range of educational, social, cultural, linguistic, and psychological issues."
Becoming Human: The Science of Us,"If you’re reading these words, we have something in common: we’re both human. But what exactly does being human really mean? Are there things that make us uniquely different to the other animals we share this planet with? Can we ever hope to catalogue what these differences are, or discover when, where and why we acquired them? This module explores how 21st century science is seeking to answer the big questions about our origins and about our relationships with each other and the rest of the natural world. So, if you’re interested in finding out a bit more about yourself, and why an accurate understanding of our past has profound implications for how we live our lives today, then this is the elective for you..."
The Chemistry of Periodic Elements,"This course will provide an accessible education in the chemical sciences for all. The course will cover the history of the discovery and identification of the elements that make up the modern periodic table, we will explore the elements in a literary context (through Levi’s Periodic Table), and we will dive into the modern roles of the elements and chemistry in society. The course will also introduce you to the practical aspects of the sciences through hands on experimentation, observation, analysis, and reporting. If you want to explore the central science (chemistry) and its applications, then this is the elective for you!"
"Latin: One Language, Many Cultures","Latin was a living language, and the leading one in Western Europe, for over a millennium: it was a language of power, but also the language in which ordinary people expressed. Latin was also the main form of communication of ideas in the Humanities and Sciences until the early modern period. Acquiring the foundations of Latin empowers you to access a wider English vocabulary, which is significantly Latin based; to enhance your understanding of concepts you encounter in your subjects and in your cultures; to detect the connections between English and modern European languages and the differences between them; to make sense of monumental and private inscriptions everywhere to be seen in urban and rural landscapes across Europe; to encapsulate a personal sentiment in an effective motto. The module expands the intellectual scope of the study of the language to embrace issues of colonialism and cultural transfer, change and continuity, social diversification and artistic use of shared language, the problematic nature of etymology and its ideological implications, and, most importantly, how language shapes the thought and worldview of individuals and nations."
Ages of Empire,"Empires have powerfully shaped the modern world, politically and economically, socially and environmentally, driving change from mass population movements to the spread of global languages or ecological transformations driven by capitalist energies. This Elective module rises to the challenge posed by the sheer diversity and range of impacts produced by empires from the seventeenth to the twentieth centuries, and across the globe, by exploring a wide range of ‘imperial moments’. Some of these will be a historical event such as a battle or a treaty, but others could be a text (a personal memoir, a speech, a manifesto), an image (a poster, painting, map or photograph), an artefact (like an item of clothing) or a site. They allow the opportunity to range across space and time, exploring empire as understood or advanced by imperial powers or as received, endured or engaged with by colonized peoples. The module should appeal to you if you are interested in powerful forces which shaped the modern world, but also in the lived experiences of people encountering ‘empire’. It will give you lots of scope to explore topics, times and places of particular interest to you, whether individually or in groups."
Inequality in the 21st Century,"This module is about inequality, one of the most urgent problems of our time. Inequality can lead to social problems such as poor health, political polarisation, and less cooperation between people. The module will discuss both economic and social inequality. Economic inequality concerns the distribution of money in society, while social class will be used to talk about social inequality. The module will also address inequality from an intersectional perspective, highlighting how different characteristics such as gender, race, income, and social class can confer advantages and disadvantages."
A World to Discover: Travel Memors and Memorabilia at Trinity,"Travel is part of everyone’s experience in the new millennium as never before. Why do people travel, though? What is the difference between travel and tourism, or between exploration and migration? How many different experiences go under the word ’travel’ (curiosity and adventure, relocation and dislocation, colonisation and war)? How are these experiences recorded, fictionalised, or altogether reimagined? What objects do people take with them in their travels, or back with them from their travels, and why? If you are interested in any of these questions, join us in our journey through personal experiences and travel records in the Library of Trinity College."
Vaccines - Friend or Foe?,"Every one in Ireland is current vaccinated against several infectious pathogens but most people don’t really know what happens within our bodies when this happens. There has also been a social movement of ‘anti-vaxxers’ that decry the need for vaccines but how do we know if these arguments are valid? If you want to be informed about how vaccines work and why they don’t always work, if you want to know if vaccines are safe and what are some of the key ethical issues about vaccines, then this is the Trinity Elective for you.."
Sustainable Development Goals and Policy Evaluation: Global Development One Target at a Time,"In 2015, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development set out 17 Sustainable Development Goals which provide a roadmap for addressing the key global challenges that the world is facing including, poverty, inequality, climate, environmental degradation, peace and justice. Combined the SDGs aim to leave no- one behind. If you are passionate about these global issues, if you want to learn more about what the world is doing to address these complex challenges, and if you want to learn how to evaluate the success of these policies in progressing the SDGs then this is the Trinity Elective for you."
Ancient Culture Lab: Homer's Experience and the Greek Language,"Have you ever wondered what is the point of studying the past? Is it all Greek to you? What is the use of ancient texts and ‘dead’ languages? In 12 short weeks and with the aid of easy to use ‘point-and-click’ online tools and multilingual web-based texts, we will ‘experiment’ with some of Homer’s greatest ideas. We will study elements of his thoughts and, with help from our tools, even some of his actual Greek. Love Homer and the ancient Greeks or hate them, they are part of our world, our language, our thought and our lives. If you are studying Chemistry or English, History, Economics or Maths, and want to know why the past, Greek, and the Greek culture matter, this Trinity Elective is the module for you."
The Art of the Megacity,"This elective explores how works of art — including literature, drama, music, film, visual art, and online/digital media — can inform us about the world’s megacities, which are defined as urban areas with over 10 million people. We will also ask whether megacities themselves can be considered works of art, and how experiences of a city can be read as a type of performance. We are reaching across disciplines and faculties to widen students’ horizons in both global and artistic dimensions, using this opportunity to think about how we might contribute ourselves to the city of the future. 2019-20 cities include Moscow, Tokyo, Cairo, Mexico City, Lagos, New York, Shanghai, and Mumbai. This"
Design Thinking,"Sometimes we try to solve problems without understanding them from the perspective of those experiencing them. Thinking like a designer can transform the way in which we approach complex societal challenges. Design Thinking is a methodology to solve complex problems and find creative, innovative and desirable solutions. It is an iterative process in which we seek to understand the user, challenge any assumptions, and redefine problems in an attempt to identify innovative solutions to complex problems that might not be apparent or obvious."
Cancer: The Patient Journey,"Most of us have some personal experience with cancer – be it ourselves, family, a friend. By 2020, 1 in 2 of us will get cancer in our lifetime. Cancer is the biggest killer in Ireland, with approximately 1 in 3 people dying of cancer-related illness. Despite this, many of us don’t know that much about cancer. If you would like to know more about cancer; How and why we get cancer? Why is cancer increasing in society, and what can I do to alter my risk? How is cancer detected and diagnosed? Who will make decisions about my treatment? Why are there so many treatment types, and what will work for me? Will I be cured? What if my cancer can’t be cured? What will happen afterwards? Knowledge is our greatest weapon against cancer, so if you have ever considered these questions and wanted to know more, then this is the Trinity Elective for you…"
Toolkit for a Smart & Sustainable World,"People both reshape the surface of the planet and depend on its living and non-living components for survival and wellbeing. Perhaps the biggest global challenge facing humanity today is how to achieve acceptable levels of wellbeing in the long-term, while population and per capita use of our ‘natural capital’ rises rapidly. If you want to learn about key societal challenges facing the globe, and become equipped with the tools to investigate, test and construct theoretical and practical responses to those challenges, then this elective is for you."
Displacement: Exploring the Human Experience of Forced Migration,"Recognising that forced migration represents one of the key societal challenges of our times, with an average of one person being displaced every two seconds, this Elective uses a multidisciplinary approach to provide a theoretical, practical and experiential understanding of the different causes and impacts of forced migration globally and a comprehensive and up to date analysis of historical and contemporary issues in the field. If you want to learn about these issues from researchers and practitioners in the field, those working in the creative arts to bring the individuals behind the statistics into focus, the agencies and individuals who support those who have been displaced and, most importantly, displaced people themselves, then you will find this Elective informative, enlightening and thought-provoking."
Energy in the 21st Century,"In 2016 over half of all global electricity generation was based on fossil fuel. Approximately 5% used wind and solar. But that’s up from less than 1% in 2004. It is not clear that the trend towards low carbon power generation is inexorable. There are many questions which are hotly contested, which need to be considered through critical thinking, rather than sound bites. For example: what are the practical limits of low-carbon energy technologies? How much energy do we need? How expensive is renewable power and is it a price that people can afford? What happens when the wind doesn’t blow, or at night when solar cells don’t work? In this Trinity Elective you will address the question of how the global community, and we in Ireland, should generate power for our sophisticated, comfortable, liberal civilization."
Chinese Language and Culture,"Less than a quarter of the world speaks English. Learning languages opens doors to the other three-quarters – and a world of hidden opportunities. Whatever goals you have in life, personal and professional, being able to communicate in more than one language has many benefits. Developing language skills expands your understanding of other cultures, develops your critical thinking and memory skills, and transforms you into a global citizen who is comfortable and confident wherever you are. For these reasons, learning another language not only helps your university studies, it also gives you transferable skills that are highly valued by employers."

Social Innovation - Tools for Social Change,"""We need a whole new way of thinking.” Greta Thunberg, 21 February 2019. Whether you want to change the world, or help make your neighbourhood a better place to live, your desire to make a difference needs to be matched with knowledge and skills. Social innovation is the process of developing and implementing effective solutions to social and environmental issues. If you are committed to a whole new way of thinking, if you want to understand how processes of social innovation work and develop yourself to play a role, this is the Trinity Elective for you."
Black Studies,"College does not exist in a vacuum and staff and students alike are conscious of external events such as Black Lives Matter which need to be critically examined and contextualised within an academic forum. Conscious of the student demand for an elective of this type, this elective will take a multidisciplinary approach to provide a theoretical and empirical understanding of the field of Black Studies. Central to this is the need to highlight key moments of African history, its global diaspora and Black resistance. The aims of the elective are to examine the origins, relevance and scope of Black Studies, and especially its relevance for students who will come to it in an interdisciplinary manner. The elective will draw on understandings of Blackness in the diaspora through analysis of relevant texts to understand Black Studies as an intellectual examination of African history, current African political and intellectual processes and arts, as well as transformations of identities created by migration and interaction with Western culture."
Irish Landscapes: Interdiscplinary Perspectives,"Landscape has a profound impact on our lived experience and quality of life. This module will introduce students to the critical reading of landscape through an interdisciplinary approach. The Irish landscape is the product of a complex and historically dynamic interaction between environment, society, culture and ideology. This elective will provide you with insights and tools to enable you to have a more critical and nuanced understanding of Irish Landscapes."
The Psychology of the Climate Crisis,"The data are clear and unequivocal - we are rapidly running out of time to secure a liveable future on this planet. But, despite the accumulating mountain of facts and data on our growing climate and ecological crises, humanity is failing to act. Why? That is one of the central questions of our Trinity Elective module, The Psychology of the Climate Crisis. This elective will examine the role of human psychology - human thought and behaviour - in the climate and biodiversity crises. First - how did we get here? What is it about human thought and behaviour and the structures and systems we have created that produced these crises and prevents action? Second - what are the effects? How is the Climate Crisis affecting human health, behaviour, and well-being? In what way are these effects unevenly distributed across the world and what are the implications of this inequity? And finally, what does psychology have to offer in terms of solutions? How we can leverage our understanding of human thought and behaviour to mitigate the crises?"
Language and Communication in the Digital Age,"Language determines how we relate to each other. It creates the culture within which we exist and has a major role in determining our self identity. Language is much more than words or sentences – it can be verbal or non-verbal, interpersonal or with a machine. We need to understand how language ‘works’ and how meaningful communication is constructed. This knowledge can in turn be incorporated into human-computer interaction systems. This Trinity Elective will consider how technology may influence the transmission of languages and the implications this may have for minority or endangered languages. If the intersection of linguistics and technology peaks your curiosity, this is the Trinity Elective for you!"
From Planets to the Cosmos,"Astronomy is the study of everything beyond the Earth's atmosphere, including stars, planets, galaxies, and even the evolution and origin of the Universe itself. It is often referred to as the oldest of the natural sciences, and it continues to drive modern science with discoveries such as dark matter, dark energy, and the ongoing search for life beyond the Earth. This module will expose students to key events in the development of modern Astronomy and allow them to recognize that science is an evolving body of knowledge. Students will learn about the fundamentals and history of astronomical observations, and be able to understand the science behind beautiful astronomical images such as those shown above of star formation regions, supernovae, gravitational lensing of galaxies, and planets in the Solar System. Students will also learn about the discovery of thousands of new worlds around other stars, the expansion and origin of the Universe, as well as many other modern topics in astronomy."
How to live long and prosper - A lifespan approach,"By 2050, over two billion people on earth will be over 60 years old. This increased longevity is one of the major achievements of modern humans, however this increase in lifespan does not necessarily equate with an increase in healthy, disease-free years for everyone. This demographic explosion is pertinent to every person and sector of our society. We will need input from experts across many sectors including medicine, economics, science, technology, engineering, legal, business and humanities to tackle the challenges ahead. If you want to know more about some of the key challenges and opportunities associated with our expanding ageing population, then this is the Trinity Elective for you."
"Identities and Ecologies of Latin America and the Caribbean: Past, Present and Future","This Trinity Elective will introduce students to Latin America and the Caribbean as a 'New World', not as a European discovery, but as a source of ideas and practices that can help us to face the planetary crisis. The centuries-long environmental struggle of subaltern communities in the region has led to the official recognition of the legal rights of some ecosystems and to the development of theoretical, creative, and practical responses to environmental degradation. These struggles and concerns are widely portrayed in the cultural and artistic products of the region – written texts, sound, visual and audio-visual materials. This Elective provides the tools to interpret such cultural production and to apply the lessons learned in other contexts. It invites you to engage with environmental humanities perspectives and methodologies relevant not only to Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences (AHSS) participants, but also to Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines."
Systems – the Science of Everything,"Humanity faces a growing number of ‘wicked problems’, from pandemics to climate change to threats to democracy. It is clear that the solutions to these problems will not come from any one discipline, acting in isolation, but rather from a multi-disciplinary focus on the general principles of systems. From organisms to corporations, ecologies to economies, neural networks to social networks, there are shared dynamics, abstract mechanisms, and emergent functions that arise through the interaction and organisation of elements, whether those elements are cells, transistors, people, or corporations. The aim of this module is to explore those dynamics, to recognise commonalities and deep correspondences between seemingly diverse phenomena, to introduce you to the meta-science of systems, and to promote interdisciplinary or even supradisciplinary thinking. Ideas will be presented conceptually, with examples of convergence across diverse areas, including: genetics, computer science, business, economics, neuroscience, engineering, ecology, biochemistry, physics, evolution, psychology, medicine, climatology, and sociology."
Thinking Digitally and Culturally,"We use technology every day.  But our thrill at seeing science fiction ideas – like 24-7 information access and self-driving cars - become reality is offset by concerns about phenomena like filter bubbles, privacy breaches, and fake news. The relationships and tensions between the cultural elements of our lives, like our languages, values and creative practices, and the technological innovations that are now both driving and disrupting them are hard to untangle.  To do so requires you not only to be able to understand both technology and culture, but to be able to think both like a humanist and like an engineer. In this Trinity Elective you will learn how to apply an interdisciplinary approach to understanding the world, one based in an approach known as the digital humanities, which spans the gap between fields focussed on culture and those on technology."
"Music Making, The Arts and Society","This module offers you the opportunity to consider the ways in which the arts, and specifically music, can play a part in relation to the challenges we face in contemporary society, including climate change, mass migration, civil unrest, social exclusion, and navigating power relations. You will explore ways in which citizens can engage in the arts to engender social change. You will question whether artists have an obligation to serve communities and how they might do this. You will be guided from engagement with theoretical concepts, multidisciplinary literature, and real-world examples (in the lectures), through action, creation and communication (the in-person music creation sessions and the group assignment), to reflection (the individual assignment)."
The Politics of Peace & Conflict in a Globalised World,"Addressing the complex and evolving nature of war and peace-making has become one of the key societal challenges of our age. As a scholarly discipline, Peace Studies has a particular concern for developing an understanding of the origins of violent conflicts (locally, regionally and internationally) and possibilities for their resolution and transformation, as well as the conditions for building sustainable and just peace. The primary purpose of this module is to introduce relevant concepts and theories and discuss the processes and dynamics of peacebuilding. Our focus will be strongly cross- and interdisciplinary: we will examine the debates taking place within history, political science, international relations, conflict resolution, gender studies and other relevant scholarly fields. The module will also facilitate stimulating conversations between theory and reality, grounding our class discussions in detailed case studies."
Emergence of Technologies,"You should take this elective because it will be both entertaining and challenging. The elective will explore how technologies work, why they emerge and how they will affect our future. This elective is suitable for all students. It will give you a new and interesting perspective on how humanity has developed in the past and what the future is likely to bring. The only prerequisites are a sense of curiosity and the willingness to change the way you interpret the world."
"Life and Death in Data: Plagues, Pestilence, and Pandemics","Infectious diseases with pandemic potential have emerged regularly throughout history while epidemics are an ongoing problem that populations across the globe deal with on a regular basis. From the Black Death to COVID-19, this module will explore the science, history, and mystery of pandemic disease. When will the Next Big One emerge and how can we prepare for it? Are pandemics independent misfortunes, or linked? Are we causing them? Through this module we will learn how COVID fits into earlier pandemics in human history, and how our economic, social, political and medical responses compare with how people have dealt with pandemics at different points in history. We will also work to develop our statistical literacy, understand key infectious disease metrics, and learn how to identify misrepresentations and misinterpretations of data."
Travel and English Literature,"We live in a world where issues of travel dominate the headlines - Europe’s refugee crisis on land and sea, US immigration policy and the treatment of migrants, Brexit and the Irish border, and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. This module is firmly positioned within the cultural context of these societal challenges and, throughout, you will explore the multiple ways in which English literature - past and present - engages with ideas of travel. If you have a passion for all things travel-related; if you want to evaluate diverse representations of travel in poetry, novels, and stories; if you want to develop your skills as a critical reader and thinker, then this is the Trinity Elective for you."
Engaging in the Digital World: Today and Tomorrow,"You engage with digital media every day – whether through mobile phones, smart assistants like Alexa, website interaction, games, virtual reality, or smart devices, etc. With or without your knowledge, you are providing information about who you are, what you are doing, and how you are living to these systems, and AI-based algorithms are using your data to make predictions about your behaviour. The future is expected to be increasingly multimodal, where we will use natural modes of communication to interact - speech, gesture, touch, etc. If you want to have a deeper understanding of what lies beneath these digital engagements today and in the future, taking this module will empower you to understand these interactive digital media experiences and to critically evaluate their capabilities."

Decoding Genetics: The building blocks of life,"Each human comprises about 40 trillion cells with 3 billion letters of coded information (DNA) in each cell (the human genome) that is essential for our health and which when defective causes many disorders. This elective will take you from the basic principles of genetics to the latest revolutionary advances in genomics. New methods of genome sequencing and gene editing are transforming our understanding of biology leading to advances in medicine, drug development, forensic science, bioethics and even our perspective on human evolution. This will have enormous ramifications for society. This elective will inform you on the human genome, the current state of knowledge and likely future developments allowing you to contribute to a wider societal debate."
Defence from the Dark Arts: Science and other Tools for Critical Thinking,"To make good decisions, we first need to assess credible information, and then validate it. We are presented with a flood of information daily, including data — much of it is misleading, misconstrued or manipulated. How do we make sure we pick the best information to make our decisions? Also, we spot misinformation everywhere that serves to reduce trust in science and undermine democratic institutions. Given the short time any of us have to filter and analyse these waves of information to make informed choices, critical thinking has become essential. This module will provide students with a toolbox of critical thinking skills, drawing on everyday examples to support them to use them regularly and efficiently."
Contemporary Art Angles,"This elective will introduce you to the way artists think, construct knowledge, and communicate, verbally and through their work. The idea of creative thinking and action has become so familiar a refrain in our contemporary language that it can seem rhetorical, so it may be of interest to you to understand how in artists hands, engagement with different forces and themes are self generated and often overlap with personal interests. The label of the artist has come to be applied in increasingly generic ways. Is the future for artists work under threat now in an increasingly instrumentalized world - does this matter ? This elective will look at ideas, things, skills and communication and it will require your consistent attendance. You should take this elective on because it requires a measure of your creativity, experiment and open ended action in relation to communicating in known and alternative ways. This is evidenced through the construction of a contextual notebook."
